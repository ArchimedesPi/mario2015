# SC3
### Why another HTML5 game?
This one's more an engine, for future top-downs and side scrollers.

### How do I play it?
`git clone` the repo, `npm install`, and `gulp play`.
Oh yeah, and **because I felt like it**.

### How do I work on it?
`git clone` the repo.
`gulp serve` opens a new browser tab containing the game.
The page will automatically recompile and reload as you change code.
